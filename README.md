# iboot-exploit-odysseus-bundles

Modified Odysseus bundles for up/downgrading with xerub's iOS 7 iBoot exploit. To use these bundles, first download Odysseus from here:

https://dayt0n.github.io/odysseus/odysseus-0.999.zip

Next, copy the modified bundles to the FirmwareBundles folder inside Odysseus. To build the ipsw, type `cd odysseus/macos` or if you're using a Linux system, type `cd odysseus/linux`, and then type `./ipsw /path/to/original/ipsw /path/to/custom_ipsw -bbupdate`. NOTE: Do not use `bbupdate` flag if you want to preserve the currently installed baseband.

### Update

I made new, and improved bundles for iPhone3,1 and iPhone5,2 which now include @dora_iOS's untethered ramdiskF.dmg. This is the full changelog:

* @dora_iOS's /ramdiskF.dmg is now included, so you can now boot an iBEC without issues, and boot untethered using a patched iBoot

* Added iOS 5.0-5.1.1 bundles for iPhone3,1, and fixed iPhone3,1/iOS 6.1.3 bundle

* Removed OpenSSL and other useless files, e.g .DS_Store

* Restore ramdisk is now 3 MBs smaller

* Typing reboot_bak will automatically set NVRAM variables and dd /ramdiskF.dmg to /dev/rdisk0s1s3 before rebooting

### Update 2.0

Changelog:

* Added all firmware bundles that were not included before for iPhone5,2 excluding iOS 10.x, iOS 9.3 (13E233), iOS 8.4.1 (as it is OTA signed) and beta builds

* Added iPhone3,1 iOS 7.1 and 7.1.1 bundles

* Fixed iPhone5,2 iOS 6.1.3, 8.3 and 8.4 bundles

* Apple logo, device tree and kernel cache are no longer decrypted when iPhone3,1 bundles are used, since ipwndfu by @axi0mX can be used to enter pwned DFU mode

### Update 3.0

I've made iPhone5,1 firmware bundles since the iPhone5,2/11B554a payload actually works on all iOS 7.0.x firmwares on the iPhone5,1 and iPhone5,2. Disclaimer: these bundles are not tested, as I don't have an iPhone5,1, and if the bundles are broken, create an issue here, PM /u/Benfxmth on reddit, or DM @benfxmth on Twitter.

### Thanks to

* @xerub for the amazing iBoot exploit

* @dora_iOS for making De Rebus Antiquis untethered
